# Feedback on Final

Overall, great work on the final project. I appreciated the comments throughout to help me understand the steps you took and why.

Your function that assigns therapy profiles is good, but a couple of suggestions to consider:
* Organize your if/then into a hierarchy instead of all four conditions together -- sometimes that makes things easier to understand
* Make sure you have tests for your functions to verify everything returns the results expected

For the lack of clearer test cases (-5 on Modularity/Style)

Overall, solid work on teh final.
